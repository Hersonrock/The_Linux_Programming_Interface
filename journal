Today I studied from page 113 to 115
I spent most of the time learing about the calls
-getppid()
-getpid()
-kill()
Im trying to prove what is being said that when a parent dies the child
processes are re-parented to init.
Now the current parent is bash so I'm seeing some issues with making the test
work.
I guess I will need to use something like fork() to create a test that does not
involve bash.

Today I worked further on the "kill_parent.c" program which worked!
I used the fork() call to make a child and orhpaned the process by killing the
parent with a signal 15.

The child with the same pid was now under init as the parent.
Read from page 115 to page 118

Today was a rought day I read from page 118 to 138
I learned about Stack and stack frames, as well as Virtual memory management
and memory layout
I also spend some time working with enviroment list and the four functions 
explained on the chapted
-putenv()
-getenv()
-setenv()
-unsetenv()

I feel conflicted as evevn though I know environment variables can be useful
for things like process intercomunication I have not seen the need to use
enviroment variables on my own programs.

as a project I wrote a small test program that shows me how getenv() and the 
extern char **environ works.

Today I spend an ungodly amount of time reading this chapter my brain was 
not understanding anything. I hope tomorrow is better.
