Today I studied from page 113 to 115
I spent most of the time learing about the calls
-getppid()
-getpid()
-kill()
Im trying to prove what is being said that when a parent dies the child
processes are re-parented to init.
Now the current parent is bash so I'm seeing some issues with making the test
work.
I guess I will need to use something like fork() to create a test that does not
involve bash.

Today I worked further on the "kill_parent.c" program which worked!
I used the fork() call to make a child and orhpaned the process by killing the
parent with a signal 15.

The child with the same pid was now under init as the parent.
