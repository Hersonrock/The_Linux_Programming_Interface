I'm going to do some focus study sessions on this chapter and I'm planning on
making some projects to practice the concepts. 

So far I got the idea of making 

1) A file splitter and merger, I remember when I was a kid I found this program
called "Axe" and what it did was allow me to break a file into multiple files
and then merge them as well.

I'll do my own! I'll create a program that is able to split files in half and a
allow me to merge them as well


2) I copied a program from chapter 4 which is using lseek(), I'll start by 
appropiately documenting this program,( which I copied on this directory
as "filehole") and then I'll think of  my useful program idea for it.

3) On this chapter we also talk about the general-purpose ioctl() function I'llw
work on creating a program that uses it, even if it is really simple.

4) Another fun idea is to create a file encryptor and decryptor.(Extra) I could 
use this to practice later on.
