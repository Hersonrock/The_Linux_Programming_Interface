Today I started by creating the skeleton of the main program functions.

Studying the program sample from the book I can see the following point

1) buffer size is a const , is not dynamic( Maybe this is a good thing?)
2) There is a USAGE message for the program. I sometimes forget about this.
3) Open, Read, Write, Close function have error checking.

I'll start writing this function tomorrow.
