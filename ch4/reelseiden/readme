----README----

The main goal of this program is to be able to take any file and split in two 
parts, and then be able to merge them together.

A clear enhancement to it would be to make it so it can split files in N pieces
(given some limitations ofcourse)

Requirements will be

1) Make a function that can open files and read them into a buffer.
(Im not sure if this buffer should be of variable size or not)

2) Make a function that can create a file and write to it, the contents of a
buffer.

3) Make a function that can append a file to other, hopefully this will be 
enough to merge the two halves together.

4) Make some function that someway given a fraction of the file it knows what 
numbered piece is it. Lets say I broke a program in 4 pieces, I should be able 
to know by reading the piece that it is the 4th piece. Not rely on the filename
-------------

[DONE] Create a function that can open a file and read them into a buffer.
[DONE] Create a function that can write from a buffer to a file.
[DONE] Create a function that can read a file and split it into n files.
[DONE] Create a function that can merge two split files.
	[DONE] Create an algorithm that writes metadata about the splitfiles.
	[DONE] Create a proper function that reads this metadata
	[DONE] Create a function that uses this metadata to write the merged
	file.
[PENDING] Adding input prompts to select what file to split and what file to
merge
[PENDING] Adding a naming scheme option for outputs pieces.
